## Introduction

Within the interlabs program, R code performs data processing, plots and statistics generation. As an aside, an ancillary collection of spreadsheets with Excel code and python code are used in sample preparation and pre-processing.

The R code ("base code") continues to evolve to serve the new requirements and exploratory analysis in the interlabs program. With the rapid advancement and frequent customizations, it was recognized the analysis process would benefit from comprehensive code tidying. As a rule-of-thumb, with each new feature development, teams should allocate a further 15-20% of time to resolve technical debts. There is currently no established tracking of technical debts besides some in-code comments and team members recollection.

The purpose of this document is:
1. To serve as documentation accompanying the code, and to be continually updated as the code evolves  
2. Set out practice standards for team to collectively continue hygienic data handling & coding following the refactoring project in 2023; serve as on-boarding training for new team members

## External File Structure

### Environment (Package Dependencies & Software Versions)
All work must be done on OCWA-provided laptops.  Overall restrictions applicable to OCWA operating environment will restrict software installation - manager approvals as well as IT "white-list".  The 

#### R
##### Version Check
- To check your installed version of RStudio and R, respectively, either use the GUI's or by inputting:
```r
RStudio.Version()
```

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
version
```



- To check your package versions, refer to the package window in the corner of RStudio or input:
```{r}
#| echo: fenced
print(head
      (tibble::tibble(
        Package = names(installed.packages()[,3]),
        Version = unname(installed.packages()[,3])
      ), n=600 #where n = an appropriately large value to capture all your packages
      )
)
```

#### R Packages version alignment
```{r}
#https://github.com/rstudio/renv/issues/1070
```

renv() package is used to manage project-local R dependency, with capability to also capture Python dependency (where the latter is run off RStudio using *reticulate*).  

The general workflow when working with renv is:  
1. Call renv::init() to initialize a new project-local environment with a private R library  
2. Work in the project as normal, installing and removing new R packages as they are needed in the project  
3. Call renv::snapshot() to save the state of the project library to the lockfile (called renv.lock)  
4. Continue working on your project, installing and updating R packages as needed  
5.Call renv::snapshot() again to save the state of your project library if your attempts to update R packages were successful, or call renv::restore() to revert to the previous state as encoded in the lockfile if your attempts to update packages introduced some new problems.  
  
When renv’s Python integration is active, a couple extra features will activate:  
- renv will instruct reticulate to load your project-local version of Python by default, avoiding some of the challenges with finding and selecting an appropriate version of Python on the system.  
- Calling reticulate::py_install() will install packages into the project’s Python environment by default.  
- When renv::snapshot() is called, your project’s Python library will also be captured into requirements.txt (for virtual environments) / environment.yml (for Conda environments).  
- Similarly, renv::restore() will also attempt to restore your Python environment, as encoded in requirements.txt / environment.yml from a previous snapshot.  

#### Python
- To check your version of python, use command line or in python:
```{python}
import sys
print(sys.version)
```


## Version Control
```{r}
#Yuhan's section
#### II. Training/Establishing Guidelines

#1.  Acquire training on and establish version control on Github *(2 weeks/July 2023)* *Deliverable: Training/Guidance document section, specifically method for & train team as soon as possible on version control/change management**\

### III. Preparatory Version Control & Unit Tests

#1.  Establish version control on Github. All team members to abide by training guidelines when introducing changes to main code base *(2 weeks/July 2023)*\
#    **Deliverable: Version control workflow graphic (to incl. in Training/Guidance document)**\
```

### Training/Establishing Guidelines
#### Installation and setup

##### 1. Install Git from website: <https://gitforwindows.org/>

##### 2. Check/update git version
* Go to the Start menu
* In the Search or Run line type ”cmd”and press enter
* Check git version: `git --version`
* Update git version if have git but not the latest version:`git update-git-for-windows`
    
    ![git](src/versionUpdate.gif)
    
##### 3. Introduce yourself to Git
* Type the following in cmd:
    `git config --global user.email "you@youremail.com"` 
    `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
* See result: `git config --global --list`
    
::: {.callout-note}
Note: This **must** be the email associated with your GitHub account.
:::

##### 4. Install a Git client - Need to rewrite
   
   A Git client and an integrated development environment, such as RStudio, are not necessary to use Git or R, respectively. But they make the experience more pleasant because they reduce the amount of command line and provide a richer visual representation of the current state.

   Here’s a screenshot of GitKraken (see below) open to the repository for the R package pkgdown. You get a nice graphical overview of the recent commit history, branches, and diffs, as well as a GUI that facilitates the most common Git operations.

   ![gitkraken](src/gitkrakenScreenshot.png)

#### Connect to Git, GitHub and RStudio

##### 1. Setup a new remote repository in GitHub
![repo](src/SetRepo.gif)

##### 2.Create branches

To work on different versions of the base code at one time, we need to branch off the specific branch we want to work on. It will coping all the files in the branch at that point in time.

::: {.callout-important}
Remember to select which branch you want to branch off **AND** Pull it after you create branch !!
:::

There are two ways to create a new branch in both local and remote:
   
   - From GitHub:
   
   ![gitbranch](src/GitHubBranch.gif)
   
   - From Rstudio:
     
     Switch to the branch you want to branch off (see @switch_branch section) then create branch followed by below image.
      
     ![Rbranch](src/RBranch.png)

##### 3. Connect Rstudio to GitHub and clone the repo to local
![connect](src/RStudioConnectGitHub.gif)
  
After click “Create Project” to create a new directory, which will be all of these things:
  
   - a directory or “folder” on your computer
   - a Git repository, linked to a remote GitHub repository
   - an RStudio Project

##### 4. Detect Git from RStudio
* Type `where git` in cmd to get the git executable path
* From RStudio, go to *Tools > Global Options > Git/SVN* and make sure that the box *Git executable* points to your Git executable.
    ![detect](src/detect.png)

#### Fundamentals branch workflow

##### Overall flow chart
The image below shows a overall git flow chart.
![flow](src/flow.png)

##### 1. Switch to right branch {#switch_branch}
Since people are work on different branch so before start we need to switch to our working branch. There are two methods to switch between branch:

* In Rstudio:

  Select the remote branch you want to work on by clicking the bottom (see image below), it will automatically create and switch to that local branch.
  
  ![Rbranch](src/SwitchBranch.png)
     
* In Shell: type `$ git checkout <branch_name>` in terminal

##### 2.Pull from remote

To start working on a project, pull any new changes to update local copy. If there is a merge conflict see @merge_conflict section.

* In Rstudio: Click the **Pull** bottom in the **Git** tab section

* In Shell: type `$ git pull` in terminal

##### 3. Make changes and commit 
* Click on the **Git** tab in RStudio. It will show the files that have changed or added.

![git](src/git.png)

* Click on the **Staged** check box to stage your change. Now click on **Diff** (next to **Commit**) to display a summary of what’s changed. Lines that have been added are green. Lines that have been removed are red.

![diff](src/diff.png)

* Add a commit message and click on **Commit** in this window. Every time make a commit, must also write a short **commit message**.
    
* In the **Git** tab of RStudio, click on **Diff** and then **History**. You’ll see that you can look through every commit you’ve ever made. You can also view the commit history in other Git client app. Or check your past commits though type `git log` in terminal.

![history](src/history.png)
    
* Check on the state of the Git world: type `git status` in terminal

::: {.callout-note}
For the files you don't want to push to Github you can list the them in **.gitignore** file, see @gitigore.
::: 

##### 4. Push
When you are finished and committed, remember to **Push** these changes to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub). Should see below image if successfully pushed.
    ![push](src/push.png)
   
#### Pull Request and Merge Chances between branches

Each time you want to merge/pull a branch from another branch, you will need to create a pull request. Sometimes it will show up automatically in the branch web page after you push, if not you need to do it manually.

* For the first auto case, you will see a notice to create a pull request (see the image below). Then click on the button that says **Compare and pull request** to go next step. 
![pull_auto](src/pullrequest.png)
* For the manual case, first need to click the **Pull request** tab. Then click the button that says **New pull request**. It will show up the **Compare changes** page, you need to decide the pull direction. The compare branch is the one you want to pull from. After decide the branches, click **Create pull request** button and go next step.

* Now both case are in the same **Open a pull request** page, and click on **Create pull request** to compare and merge them.

           
* GitHub has now compared the two versions of the project that are in the two branches. If there is no conflict it is telling us that there are no conflicts between the two versions and you can click the green **Merge pull request** button to merge the changes.

* If you don't need the branch, click **Confirm merge**. Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated, with the **Delete branch** button in the purple box.
![success](src/successMerge.png)

The manual pull request process: ![manual](src/manualpullrequest.gif)

#### Merge conflict {#merge_conflict}
There will be a merge conflict when you pull from the remote but have done some new work locally since the last time you pulled:

* Recent commit history of origin/main: A--B--C
    
* Recent commit history of the local main branch: A--B--D

It will show the warning below and automatically add the two version with markers in that file.
      
![conflictmessage](src/conflict.png)
      
* The code between the <<<<<<< HEAD and ======= line is the content in the current remote branch and the code between the ======= and >>>>>>> line is the content in your local that need to merge.

![marker](src/mergeconflict.png)

* Keep the version you want and remove the all the markers line (<<<<<<< HEAD:, ======, >>>>>>) inserted to demarcate the conflicts then save the file and do the following commit and push again.

    
#### Version control workflow

1. The overall workflow graph of version control.
![workflow](src/workflow.png)

2. Working location - Need to confirm

   - The home folder locations for **main** branch: 
   
     S:\WasteWater Surveillance\3_Templates_References\Round_codes
   
   - The home folder locations for **Round** branch: 
   
     S:\WasteWater Surveillance\4_WIP\O103-Interlabs\d_Code
   
   - The home folder locations for **develop** branch:
   
     S:\WasteWater Surveillance\1_QMS
   
   Clone the remote repository to local directory for each branch working.
   

3. gitignore file {#gitignore}

   To tell Git which files and directories to ignore when you make a commit. To share the ignore rules with other users who clone the repository, commit the .gitignore file in to your repository.

   The gitigonre content reference: https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/06-ignore.html

   The data/files we don't want to commit to GitHub:
    - all the data spread sheet
    - plots
    - reports

4. Unsolved questions

   - Zombie code: cut off but might come back?

## Linting / Style Guide
*General*
- camelCase 
- tab indentation
*Linting - continuous integration*
In RStudio IDE:  
- some linting is included, however it is for errors only
- selecting code and hitting Ctrl + I will re-indent code for you
  
lintr:  
lintr package will be set up with the main code to provide diagnostic linting (i.e. as opposed to auto-correction using stylr package), recommending but not enforcing stylistic changes.  It will activate with github upload workflows following this set up command, which also creates a **.github/workflows** folder with **lint.yaml**
  
More options for linting and details are available for reference at https://blog.r-hub.io/2022/03/21/code-style/ 
```{r}
usethis::use_github_action("lint")
# for context, check in console - vignette("continuous-integration")

```



===================================

## Refactoring 
- recommend every x period
- workflow

## unit testing approaches & practices 

##  Issues-tracking method


7.  Document the procedures for above practices and create training presentations for the team *(3 weeks)*\
    **Deliverable: Training/Guidance document**\
    **Deliverable: Training session**

## Unit Testing Framework
2.  Set up formal testing, enabling validation of no-loss-of-function and establishing built-in "bases" during refactoring. *(August 2023)* **Deliverable: Test framework & test-suite code**

Cursory review in June 2023 found that base code functions (more suitable for testing) are few and generally used to generate plots (unsuitable for testing). Testing may be adapted to instead inspect dataframe size & output value spot-check.

-------------------------------

1.  Packages/Libraries organization *(3 weeks / July 2023)*:
    1.  create reference document of package purpose/usage in the program (including any removed but potentially useful)
    2.  remove any currently unused packages, narrowing list/call to just the necessary ones
    3.  create packrat compilation or Docker of used packages to preserve running versions\
        **Metric: Number of superfluous packages/libraries, number TBD to 0**\
        **Deliverable: One packrat / docker with all in-use packages including versions**
2.  Linting for consistent style *(1 week; August 2023)*\
    **Deliverable: Commit \[track number\]**\
3.  Refactoring cycle, which will be repeated for each issue/potential improvment. As adapted from Fowler: 0.1 Select issue/potential improvement to work on. Create branch on version control 0.2 Introduce comments/pseudo-code for changes. Obtain consensus with *reviewer*  
**Deliverable: Branch & Commit \[track number\]**
    1.  Create getters and setters for the field\
    2.  Locate all references: replace access with calls to the getter, and changes to the field with calls to the setter\
    3.  Compile and test after changing each reference\
    4.  Declare the field as private\
    5.  Compile and test. Switch to light mode for coder & reviewer\
    6.  *Reviewer* checks pull request, code and merge. Light mode for all users\
        **Deliverable: Commit \[track number\]**
4.  Documentation updates  
**Deliverable: Code & Guidance Documentation Updates, Inventory of updated intra/external code relationships **

Dark Mode / Light Mode : We can compare pre-refactor and post-refactor behavior by employing what we've coined at Slack as the light/dark technique\
Dark mode : Both implementations are called\
The results are compared\
The results from the old implementation are returned

Light mode :\
Both implementations are called\
The results are compared\
The results from the new implementation are returned

How To ?\
Once the abstraction has been properly put in place\
Start enabling dark mode\
Monitor any differences being logged between the two result sets\
Track down and fix any potential bugs in the new implementation causing those discrepancies\
Repeat this process until you've properly handled all discrepancies, Enabling dark mode to broader groups of users

Once all users have been opted in to dark mode\
Continue logging any differences in the result sets\
Continue to opt broader groups of users into light mode, until everyone is successfully processing results from the new implementation.

Disable execution of both code paths\
Remove the old logic altogether : only the new implementation should remain

## Typical Code Issues & Correspondent Refactoring

### Refactoring methods

a.  Extraction: breaking code into chunks or utilizing existing chunks for isolation into separate functions and replaced with a call to the functions. Change patterns into abstraction. Similarly for variables
b.  Inline refactoring: finding functions calls and replacing them with the function content (opposite of extraction)
c.  Simplifying methods logic: consolidate conditional fragments and using polymorphism instead of conditionals
d.  Simplifying method calls: examining parameters involved and adding/replacing as needed

## Handling Commented-out code
\## stuff to incorp. COMMENTED-OUT CODE In the case of commented-out code, it's pretty obvious that the code is unused. I always recommend that developers who are tempted to comment-out code instead simply delete it if the code is tracked using version control. If you need it again someday, you can easily recover it by going back through your commit history.

new function to help mitigate code degradation. Let's say we write up a simple helper to encapsulate all the logic for validating a user object; we'll call it validateUser

A NOTE ABOUT COUNTING LINES OF COMMENTS By and large, ignoring comments is good practice when counting lines of code. Docblocks and inlined TODOs do not affect the behavior of our programs, so including them in our size calculations would not help us better characterize a program's complexity. In practice, however, I've noticed that you can easily pinpoint some rather perplexing sections of code by counting the number of inline comments at the function level. In general, developers tend to leave inline code comments when the surrounding logic is difficult to follow. Whether that's because the code is dealing with a complicated piece of business logic or it has just become gradually more convoluted over time, we tend to leave some pointers to others who come after us when modifying exceptionally tricky code. Therefore, we can use the quantity of inline comments within a single function, whether short or long, as a possible warning sign.

When we're working to improve an existing implementation, whatever the extent of our endeavor, we want to be sure that we're correctly retaining its behavior. We can safely assert that our new solution continues to work identically to the old by relying on the original implementation's test suite. Because we are relying on the test coverage to warn us about potential regressions, we need to verify two things before beginning our refactoring effort: first, confirm that the original implementation has test coverage and, second, determine whether that test coverage is adequate.\
refactoring requires us to be able to ensure that behavior remains identical at every iteration. We can increase our confidence that nothing has changed by writing a suite of tests (unit, integration, end to end), and we should not seriously consider moving forward with any refactoring effort until we've established sufficient test coverage.

## Unit testing notes

-   Set a canary test (it checks if the test framework works)

-   Add few (automated) tests. Start with code candidate to change first. If code wasn't designed to be testable, don't change it yet. Make your best to test it as is. This is very important.
